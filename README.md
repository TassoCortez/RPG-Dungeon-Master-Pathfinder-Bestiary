I have been playing RPG for more than 20 year, and being a Dungeon Master demands a lot of time and commitment. 

With that in mind I tried to make one of the most time demanding things for a Dungeon master easier. Monster selection. 

Pathfinder has a lot of PDF files full of monsters, but unfortunately there is no fast way to check the most important information of a monster and his image.

This project focuses on Pathfinder 1St edition Bestiary 1.

Beginning with a PDF scraper of Bestiary 1, I was able to extract all the images and names from the monsters.
With a file that has the correct name of the monster, I was able to make a Web Scraper using Selenium to get the information about the monster on www.d20pfsrd.com.

After some cleaning of the dataframe in Python and some pontual changes on Google Sheets , the file was ready to be exported to Tableau.

In my opinion the best way to display this information is on an interactive Dashboard, mainly because every time you go checking for a monster, you have different targets in mind, like level of the party, type of monster, terrain,  image of the monster and so on. 

I hope this file can help a lot of Dungeon Masters to have a great time!
