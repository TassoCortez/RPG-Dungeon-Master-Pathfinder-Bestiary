When separated in this way, the berbalang’s body is unconscious and helpless. If the berbalang’s body is injured while in this state, the separated projection immediately returns to its body, and the body loses displacement. If the physical body is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit immediately returns to the body.

When the host’s Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a brand new body as a new conqueror worm that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally).

Such a creature maintains all of its abilities. Its type changes to fey (do not recalculate any statistics), and it gains the wild hunt subtype. Its appearance changes to blend in with the wild hunt, granting it features such as long ears and glowing green eyes.

A creature reincarnated in this way can be restored to its original life only via a miracle or wish—slaying the creature and raising it from the dead merely restores it to its latest incarnation as a member of the wild hunt, unless the effect of the wild reincarnation is first removed from the body via a successful break enchantment spell against a DC of 31.
